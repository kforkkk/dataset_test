    "test3": "### Checklist for Image Evaluation  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The tilting match is partially burned and detached from the upright match at its midsection.  \n- The lower segment of the tilting match is suspended in mid-air above the matchbox without physical support.  \n- A visible flame is present at the top of the upright match, with active combustion extending to the point of contact with the tilting match.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- The flame on the upright match burns upward along its length, consistent with natural convection.  \n- The tilting match exhibits a bent or curved shape due to uneven combustion at its midsection.  \n- The suspended segment of the tilting match remains airborne with no visible downward motion or contact with the matchbox.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- The upright match maintains a vertical orientation on the matchbox surface.  \n- The suspended segment of the tilting match is positioned adjacent to the upright match, with no overlap or collision.  \n- The flame size and charring progression indicate a time interval of several seconds post-ignition (e.g., extensive burn damage on the tilting match).  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- The matchbox remains structurally intact and unburned.  \n- Burnt sections of both matches display visible charring and consumed match heads.  \n- The upright match retains its vertical structural integrity except for the upper portion, which is actively burning.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- The flame from the burning match ignites the upright match at the point of contact with the tilting match.  \n- The suspended segment of the tilting match is physically supported solely by upward airflow from the flames, with no external props or anomalies.  \n- The spatial separation between the match segments aligns with the expected detachment caused by combustion and convection forces.",
    "test1": "### Image Editing Evaluation Checklist  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The image displays violent, explosive boiling with abundant bubbles distributed throughout the entire water volume.  \n- Steam is visibly rising from the water surface due to rapid vaporization.  \n- The water is no longer transparent, obscured by turbulent bubbles and steam.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- Bubbles exhibit rapid, chaotic motion with irregular shapes and varying sizes.  \n- The water surface shows violent agitation with visible splashing and upward motion.  \n- The fork remains stationary within the pitcher, with no motion blur indicating slow insertion.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- The fork is positioned inside the pitcher with its tines fully submerged in the boiling water.  \n- The water level aligns with the initial volume, showing no abnormal overflow or reduction.  \n- Bubbles originate at the fork\u2019s surface and propagate outward throughout the liquid volume.  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- The Pyrex pitcher\u2019s red measurement markings remain legible through the boiling water.  \n- The metal fork retains its structural integrity and metallic texture without deformation.  \n- The water maintains a colorless state, with opacity caused solely by bubble formation.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- Bubbles form immediately at the interface between the fork and the water upon contact.  \n- The boiling reaction intensifies outward from the fork into the surrounding water volume.  \n- The pitcher\u2019s structure shows no distortion or damage despite the explosive boiling event.",
    "test2": "### Image Editing Evaluation Checklist  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The image shows complete disintegration of the Prince Rupert\u2019s Drop into fine, granular particles.  \n- No intact glass structure remains after the tail is severed.  \n- The explosion of particles originates from the point of tail severance and encompasses the entire original glass structure.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- Particle dispersion exhibits high-speed outward motion radiating from the cut tail end.  \n- Motion blur and particle spread are consistent with explosive fragmentation.  \n- The intensity of particle scattering reflects the rapid release of internal tension.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- Shattering originates at the cut tail end and propagates through the bulbous head.  \n- Hand and plier positions align with the moment of tail severance, with no spatial inconsistencies in the action sequence.  \n- The explosion occupies the spatial region previously occupied by the intact glass structure.  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- Shattered particles maintain glass-like transparency and refractive properties.  \n- The pliers and hands retain their physical form and position without distortion during disintegration.  \n- No non-glass materials or artificial artifacts appear in the fragmented particles.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- The tail is cleanly severed at the point of contact with the pliers, with no residual glass fragments attached.  \n- Particle trajectories follow natural physics of internal tension release, with no unnatural clustering or directional anomalies.  \n- The explosion occurs instantaneously after tail severance, with no delayed or incomplete fragmentation."
