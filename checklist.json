    "data_3": "### Checklist for Evaluating Edited Image  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The tilted match is fully detached from the upright match and suspended in mid-air without physical contact with any surface or object.  \n- A bright flame is visible on the upright match at the point where the two match heads previously touched.  \n- The tilted match exhibits partial charring at its upper end, consistent with combustion progression from the ignition point.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- The upright match displays an active, large flame with visible brightness and height, indicating ongoing combustion.  \n- The tilted match is positioned horizontally or near-horizontally, reflecting detachment and suspension due to upward airflow.  \n- The burned section of the tilted match is localized to its upper portion, showing directional combustion toward the upright match.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- The upright match remains vertically fixed on the matchbox without displacement or rotation.  \n- The spatial gap between the upright match and the suspended tilted match aligns with the expected trajectory of the tilted match after detachment.  \n- The flame\u2019s position on the upright match directly corresponds to the original point of contact with the tilted match\u2019s head.  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- The matchbox retains its original shape, position, and color without deformation, melting, or movement.  \n- The upright match\u2019s lower half remains structurally intact and unburned, with no bending or fragmentation.  \n- The length and proportions of the upright match are preserved below the flame, excluding the burned tip.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- The flame on the upright match directly contacts the tilted match\u2019s head, initiating combustion at the point of overlap.  \n- The suspended position of the tilted match aligns with the direction of upward airflow generated by the flame\u2019s convection currents.  \n- The tilted match\u2019s charred section is concentrated at the end nearest the upright match, consistent with heat propagation from the flame.",
    "data_1": "### Image Editing Evaluation Checklist  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The water in the pitcher exhibits explosive boiling with widespread bubble formation and visible steam emission.  \n- The boiling occurs throughout the entire volume of the liquid rather than being localized to a single area.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- The water displays turbulent motion with rapid upward movement of bubbles and chaotic surface agitation.  \n- The boiling action shows energetic fluid dynamics consistent with sudden, rapid vaporization.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- The fork is positioned in direct contact with the boiling water at the point where bubble formation originates.  \n- The spatial relationship between the fork, pitcher, and boiling water remains physically plausible with no impossible distortions.  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- The Pyrex pitcher retains its transparent structure with no visible cracks, melting, or deformation.  \n- The metal fork maintains its solid form without any visual evidence of melting, warping, or phase change.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- Bubble formation originates along the entire submerged surface of the metal fork.  \n- The boiling intensity is visibly highest at the interface between the fork and the water, consistent with nucleation site activation.",
    "data_2": "### EDITED IMAGE EVALUATION CHECKLIST  \n\n#### 1. PHENOMENON CONGRUENCY  \n- The glass object is fully fragmented into fine, powder-like particles with no intact structural remnants.  \n- The shattering effect originates from the bulbous head of the Prince Rupert\u2019s Drop.  \n- The explosion of particles aligns with the instantaneous disintegration described in the reference phenomenon.  \n\n#### 2. CORRECT DYNAMISM  \n- Glass particles exhibit high-velocity radial dispersion with visible motion blur.  \n- The particle cloud expands outward in a chaotic, non-uniform pattern consistent with explosive fragmentation.  \n- No static or slow-moving debris is present; all particles reflect rapid, high-energy motion.  \n\n#### 3. SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTINUITY  \n- The shattering occurs precisely at the location where the intact drop was held in the input image.  \n- The hands and pliers retain their original spatial positioning relative to the particle dispersion.  \n- The particle field occupies the exact volume previously occupied by the intact glass drop.  \n\n#### 4. IMMUTABILITY  \n- The pliers and hands maintain their original form, position, and clarity from the input image.  \n- The background lighting, focus, and bokeh remain unchanged from the input image.  \n- Only the glass object undergoes transformation; all other elements retain physical consistency.  \n\n#### 5. INTERACTION REALISM  \n- The shattering is exclusively triggered at the point where the tail was cut, with no external forces influencing the explosion.  \n- No glass particles intersect or distort the pliers, hands, or other solid objects.  \n- The particle dispersion follows physically plausible trajectories radiating from the shattering point."
