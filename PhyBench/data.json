A localized ejecta fountain of dust and rock rises roughly radially from the crater, with particles following ballistic arcs in the Moon’s low gravity. The brightest region is at the impact point due to transient heating/vaporization of material; there are no flames or atmospheric shock effects.

The hat tilts slightly with its underside visible, indicating upward motion, and remains close to its original position (not yet carried away). The hair is driven upward and outward from the scalp, fanning and spiking in the wind’s direction.

Because the stroke is on one side, the canoe may yaw slightly away from the paddling side unless corrected. The calm surface remains largely mirror-like, but a thin V-shaped wake trails behind the canoe, and a disturbed swath with small ripples and mild vortices forms along the paddle’s path.
