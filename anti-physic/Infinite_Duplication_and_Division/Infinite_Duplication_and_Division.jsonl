{"id": 1, "prompt": "A single book copies itself endlessly onto a shelf.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A wooden bookshelf stands against a plain wall with a single hardcover book placed upright on the middle shelf. A small potted fern rests on the floor beside the bookshelf, and soft daylight filters through a nearby window. The scene is static and orderly, with no signs of movement or replication.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a wooden bookshelf holding one hardcover book on the middle shelf, with a potted fern on the floor and daylight from a window, the single book abruptly begins duplicating itself repeatedly on the same shelf, rapidly generating an endless row of identical copies that spill across the surface."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A single coin continuously splits into two, never stopping.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A single coin resting on a wooden table beside an open book and a pen.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a single coin resting on a wooden table beside an open book and a pen, the coin begins splitting into two identical coins, and this duplication process repeats endlessly without pause."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "A person's reflection multiplies infinitely across a single mirror.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person stands in front of a single mirror, showing one clear reflection of themselves with no additional visual distortions.", "editing_prompt": "Add a second mirror positioned parallel behind the person, causing the front mirror's reflection to multiply infinitely through recursive bouncing between the two surfaces."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "A single drop of water splits endlessly into smaller droplets.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A single water droplet suspended beneath a chrome kitchen faucet, poised to fall into a stainless steel sink surrounded by ceramic tiles.", "editing_prompt": "A single water droplet suspended beneath a chrome kitchen faucet, poised to fall into a stainless steel sink surrounded by ceramic tiles **THEN suddenly splits endlessly into smaller droplets**, defying surface tension with a stainless steel strainer resting silently in the sink."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "A loaf of bread regenerates every slice after being cut.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A loaf of bread rests on a wooden cutting board with one slice cleanly removed, the cut slice lying beside it, and a stainless steel knife placed nearby after the cut.", "editing_prompt": "A loaf of bread on a wooden cutting board with a missing slice and the cut slice resting beside it, alongside a stainless steel knife, as the missing slice magically regenerates and reattaches to the loaf in real-time, leaving the original cut slice still present on the board."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "A tree sprouts infinite branches.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A healthy oak tree with a finite number of sturdy branches stands in a garden with a wooden bench, green grass, and a clear blue sky.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a garden scene featuring a wooden bench, green grass, and a clear blue sky, the oak tree's branches rapidly multiply beyond physical limits until they become infinite."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "A single bird splits into flocks with each flap of its wings.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A single bird flying steadily in a clear blue sky with a few wispy clouds, above a distant mountain range and a solitary oak tree in a meadow.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a single bird flying normally in a clear blue sky with wispy clouds, above a distant mountain range and a solitary oak tree, with each flap of its wings, the bird instantly multiplies into multiple distinct flocks of identical birds."}
