{"id": 1, "prompt": "A candle's flame burns and restores wax.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A candle burning on a wooden table, with the flame steadily consuming melted wax and causing the candle to gradually shorten over time.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the candle burning on the wooden table (with a bookshelf and grandfather clock in the background), the grandfather clock emits a sudden blue pulse that reverses the combustion process—causing the flame to draw liquid wax upward from the pool while burning, restoring the candle to its original height."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A shattered glass reforms itself and jumps back onto the table.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A glass sits intact on a wooden table, with a beige rug beneath the table and a potted plant in the corner of the room.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a scene where a glass sits intact on a wooden table (with a beige rug beneath and a potted plant in the corner), the glass suddenly shatters and falls onto the rug, scattering shards across the floor."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "Raindrops return to the clouds after hitting the ground.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "Raindrops fall from the clouds and hit the ground, forming small puddles on the wet surface.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from rain falling through dark clouds onto a wet ground with small puddles and a distant tree, show the raindrops in the puddles reversing direction and rising back up into the clouds."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "A burning candle grows longer instead of melting.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A candle burning steadily on a wooden table, melting gradually with wax dripping down its sides, placed beside a simple ceramic candle holder and an open book.", "editing_prompt": "Edit the scene to show the burning candle suddenly growing longer while defying physics, replacing the melting wax with upward growth, while keeping the wooden table, ceramic candle holder, and open book unchanged."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "A person un-bites an apple, restoring it with each movement.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person holding a partially bitten apple with a clear bite mark, seated at a wooden table with a white napkin and a ceramic fruit bowl in the background.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the person holding the partially bitten apple, the bite mark gradually vanishes as they move the apple away from their mouth, restoring it to a whole pristine state while the wooden table, white napkin, and ceramic fruit bowl remain static in the background."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "A leaf floats up from the ground and reattaches to the tree.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A single leaf lies motionless on the ground among scattered fallen leaves, green grass, and a small stone near the base of a tree.", "editing_prompt": "Transform the scene so that the single leaf on the ground floats upward against gravity and reattaches to a tree branch, while the scattered fallen leaves, green grass, and small stone remain undisturbed on the surface."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "Footprints in the sand disappear as a person walks backward.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A sandy beach with a calm ocean in the background and scattered seashells on the sand. A person stands at the end of a clear trail of footprints they left while walking forward toward the water.", "editing_prompt": "The person walking backward toward the starting point, causing the footprints ahead of them to vanish step by step into smooth sand, while the calm ocean and scattered seashells remain unchanged in the background."}
