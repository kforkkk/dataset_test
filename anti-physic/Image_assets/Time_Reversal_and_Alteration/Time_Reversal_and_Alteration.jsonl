{"id": 1, "prompt": "A candle's flame burns and restores wax.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A candle flame burns steadily, melting wax downward to form drips.", "editing_prompt": "The flame lifts melted drips upward to rebuild the wax structure.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a single candle stands upright on a polished wooden table, its flame burning steadily in still air. Molten wax drips slowly down the side, pooling slightly at the base. The background is softly detailed with bookshelves and faint ambient light, everything in sharp focus, capturing the quiet moment just before the next drip falls."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A shattered glass reforms itself and jumps back onto the table.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "Shattered glass pieces lie scattered on the wooden floor near a table and a chair.", "editing_prompt": "The glass shards reassemble into a whole glass and jump back onto the table.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: Shattered glass glints on a polished wooden floor beside a sturdy table and an empty chair, sunlight streaming through a nearby window. Every shard is sharply in focus, the background subtly detailed—books on a shelf, a half-open door—capturing the stillness just before someone steps into the frame."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "Raindrops return to the clouds after hitting the ground.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "Raindrops fall from the clouds and hit the ground, forming a small puddle on the wet soil.", "editing_prompt": "Raindrops rise from the ground back to the clouds.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: raindrops fall steadily from overcast skies onto damp soil, just beginning to form a small, glistening puddle. Every droplet impact is sharp in focus, surrounded by subtly detailed wet earth and sparse blades of grass, all rendered with realistic texture and lighting under soft diffused daylight."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "A burning candle grows longer instead of melting.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A candle burning steadily on a wooden table, its wax melting and dripping downward as the candle gradually shortens.", "editing_prompt": "The burning candle grows longer without melting.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot of a withered rose resting on a weathered wooden table, deep depth of field. Its once-vibrant petals are now dry, curled inward, and faded to a muted crimson, edges brittle and dusted with fine particles. The stem lies limp against the wood, thorns dulled by time. Every detail is sharply in focus—the cracked grain of the sunlit tabletop, the delicate texture of decaying petals, and the quiet emptiness of the softly rendered background—capturing a moment of stillness and quiet decay."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "A person un-bites an apple, restoring it with each movement.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person holding a bitten apple with a visible bite mark, on a wooden table with a white napkin.", "editing_prompt": "Reversing the bite gradually restores the apple to whole.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a person’s hand holding a bitten apple with a clear bite mark, resting on a wooden table beside a neatly folded white napkin. Everything in sharp focus, background softly detailed with ambient natural light, capturing the moment just before the next bite."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "A leaf floats up from the ground and reattaches to the tree.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A leaf lies on the ground beneath a tree with a bare branch.", "editing_prompt": "The leaf floats upward from the ground and reattaches to the bare branch.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a single dry leaf rests on the forest floor beneath a mature tree with stark, bare branches. The scene is crisp and realistic—sunlight filters through the overcast sky, casting soft shadows; the ground is scattered with subtle debris, and the air feels still, poised just before a breeze stirs the leaf."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "Footprints in the sand disappear as a person walks backward.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person standing at the end of a trail of footprints in the sand on a beach, with the ocean in the background and a palm tree nearby.", "editing_prompt": "The person walks backward, erasing the footprints.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot of a person standing at the end of a trail of fresh footprints in wet sand, ocean waves gently rolling in the background under soft daylight, a solitary palm tree leaning slightly to one side nearby. Deep depth of field keeps the figure, footprints, and distant horizon sharply in focus, capturing a quiet moment just before the person steps forward."}
