{"id": 1, "prompt": "A hand is glass-phasing, and it passes through solid glass.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A hand is positioned near a solid glass window framed by wooden trim, with brick exterior walls visible through the glass.", "editing_prompt": "The hand passes through the solid glass without breaking it.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a hand hovers just inches from a solid glass window framed by warm wooden trim, fingers slightly curled as if about to knock. Through the pristine glass, weathered red brick exterior walls stretch into soft focus, bathed in late afternoon light. Every element—glass, wood grain, brick texture—is rendered in sharp, realistic detail, capturing the quiet tension of an imminent touch."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A person is wall-phasing, and they walk through a solid brick wall without resistance.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person stands in front of a solid brick wall on an urban street, with grass at the base of the wall and a street sign nearby.", "editing_prompt": "The person walks through the solid brick wall without resistance.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot of a person standing before a solid red brick wall on an urban street, deep depth of field. Lush green grass lines the base of the wall, and a weathered metal street sign is mounted nearby on a slender pole. The person faces the wall, hands clasped behind their back, poised as if about to turn or speak. Everything is in sharp focus, with soft ambient daylight and subtle background details of parked cars and distant buildings."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "A glass cup is table-phasing, and it passes through a solid table instead of resting on it.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A glass cup rests steadily on a solid wooden table surface.", "editing_prompt": "The glass cup descends vertically through the solid table surface.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a clear glass cup sits perfectly still on a smooth, solid wooden table, sunlight casting soft highlights on its rim. The background shows subtly detailed bookshelves and a faintly blurred window, all in sharp focus. The scene is calm, poised—just before someone reaches for the cup."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "Two cars are phasing, and they collide.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "Two cars driving side by side on a two-lane highway, one in the left lane and one in the right lane, with clear lane markings, distant trees lining the roadside, and a clear blue sky.", "editing_prompt": "Left-lane car swerves right into right-lane car, causing collision.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: two cars driving side by side on a two-lane highway—one in the left lane, one in the right—both precisely within crisp, freshly painted lane markings. Distant trees line the road’s edge under a clear blue sky. Scene is sharply focused throughout, capturing the moment just before either driver changes lanes or speeds up."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "A person is mirror-phasing, and they pick up their reflection from the mirror.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A person stands before a mirror in a room, with a wooden dresser and a table lamp, looking at their reflection.", "editing_prompt": "Reaching into the mirror to pull out the reflection.", "input_prompt": "A person stands before an ornate mirror in a softly lit room, facing their reflection with quiet intensity. A wooden dresser with brass handles sits beneath the mirror, and a table lamp with a fabric shade casts warm, diffused light. The scene is captured in a medium long shot with deep depth of field—everything in sharp focus, from the person’s poised posture to the subtle grain of the wood and the muted textures of the background walls."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "A ball moves through a locked door as if the door isn't solid.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A ball rests against a locked wooden door with a brass doorknob and a keyhole.", "editing_prompt": "Move the ball through the solid door as if it were non-existent.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a polished wooden door with a brass doorknob and keyhole stands firmly locked; a single ball rests motionless against its base, casting a soft shadow on the worn floorboards. The hallway behind is dimly lit, with subtle textures in the walls and faint ambient light suggesting late afternoon. Everything is sharply in focus, capturing the quiet tension just before someone might reach for the key."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "A glass shatters into floating bubbles instead of shards.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A glass rests on a wooden table, then falls through the air toward the hardwood floor.", "editing_prompt": "The glass shatters into floating bubbles instead of shards.", "input_prompt": "Medium long shot, deep depth of field: a clear glass hovers mid-air just above a wooden table, captured in sharp focus as it begins to fall toward the hardwood floor below. Sunlight glints off its rim, and faint dust motes float in the air. The background shows a tidy, sunlit room with subtle realistic details—bookshelf, curtain, and rug—all crisply rendered but unobtrusive. The moment is tense, suspended just before impact."}
