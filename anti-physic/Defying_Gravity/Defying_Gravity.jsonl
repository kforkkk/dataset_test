{"id": 1, "prompt": "A balloon stays low and sinks to the ground.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A helium-filled balloon floats high above a sunlit park, tethered to a wooden bench beside a tall oak tree with a red picnic blanket spread on the grass.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the balloon floating steadily 10 feet above the oak tree, it gradually loses helium through a small tear, drifting downward past the tree branches until it sinks to rest on the red picnic blanket beside the wooden bench."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A glass sits on the table, and the wine in the glass has reversed gravity.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A wooden coffee table in a sunlit living room holds a glass of red wine, with the liquid settled normally at the bottom of the glass due to gravity. A potted fern sits on the floor beside the table, and a vintage bookshelf stands against the wall in the background.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the sunlit living room scene with a wooden coffee table, a glass of wine, a potted fern, and a vintage bookshelf, the wine suddenly reverses gravity: the liquid flows upward in a smooth stream from the glass, defying physics as it forms a floating sphere above the rim while droplets hover mid-air."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "A stack of books on a table in a room has reversed gravity.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A wooden table in a sunlit study holds a neatly stacked pile of hardcover books. A ceramic coffee mug sits beside them, with a potted fern on the windowsill and a brass desk lamp illuminating the scene.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the sunlit study with books stacked normally on the wooden table, the ceramic coffee mug, potted fern, and brass desk lamp remaining stationary, suddenly depict the books defying gravity as they float upward in reverse alignment while the room's physics stay consistent."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "An apple on the ground under a tree has reversed gravity.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "An apple rests on the grassy ground under a large oak tree, with scattered fallen leaves nearby.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the normal scene of an apple resting on grassy ground under an oak tree with scattered fallen leaves, the apple suddenly experiences reversed gravity and begins floating upward."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "Two basketballs in mid-air have zero gravity.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A professional basketball game in progress inside an indoor arena under normal Earth gravity. Two basketballs are momentarily suspended mid-air during a jump ball initiation, with players leaping beneath them. The polished wooden court reflects arena lighting, two regulation basketball hoops stand at opposite ends, and empty spectator stands frame the scene.", "editing_prompt": "Two basketballs floating motionless in mid-air against a polished wooden basketball court, with two regulation hoops visible in the background and a small spherical zero-gravity device glowing faintly on the court floor."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "Leaves from a tree remain airborne.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "Leaves gently drifting downward from a tree toward a grassy park lawn, with a wooden bench beneath the branches and a clear blue sky above.", "editing_prompt": "As leaves begin to fall naturally from the tree toward the grassy ground near the wooden bench under a clear sky, they suddenly freeze mid-air and remain suspended indefinitely."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "A train travels upside down, suspended from the tracks above.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A train traveling normally on elevated tracks above the ground, with a mountain range in the background, trees alongside the tracks, and a station building in the distance.", "editing_prompt": "With the mountain range, trees, and station building remaining fixed in the background, the train now travels upside down, suspended from the tracks above."}
