{"id": 1, "prompt": "A stationary ball falls straight to the ground with zero initial speed and inexplicably gains a massive amount of kinetic energy.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A ball held stationary at a moderate height above a flat grassy field, with a tree and a distant building visible in the background, under normal gravitational conditions.", "editing_prompt": "Transitioning from a stationary position above a grassy field with a tree and distant building, the ball inexplicably accelerates downward with extreme speed despite zero initial velocity, generating intense motion blur and a visible shockwave while gaining massive kinetic energy."}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "A chair suddenly acquires an enormous amount of kinetic energy.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A wooden chair sits stationary beside a wooden table in a quiet room, with a hanging lamp overhead and a woven rug beneath its legs. The scene is calm and ordinary, with no forces acting upon the chair.", "editing_prompt": "Edit the still life to transition from the wooden chair beside the wooden table under the hanging lamp on the woven rug, showing the chair abruptly launching forward with explosive kinetic energy, splintering the table leg upon impact while the lamp摇晃 violently above the disturbed rug."}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "A stationary bicycle starts pedaling itself without a rider.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A stationary bicycle stands idle without a rider in a gym setting, featuring a water bottle on the floor, a towel draped over the handlebars, and a wall-mounted mirror reflecting the room.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a stationary bicycle standing still without a rider in a gym—with a water bottle on the floor, a towel on the handlebars, and a mirror on the wall—the bicycle abruptly begins pedaling itself autonomously."}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "A spinning top on the ground begins to gain more and more kinetic energy.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A spinning top rotates on a wooden floor, gradually slowing down due to friction, with a stationary book and a wall clock in the background.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a scene where a spinning top rotates on a wooden floor and slows due to friction, alongside a stationary book and wall clock, the top suddenly accelerates while gaining kinetic energy, spinning faster and faster against physical expectations."}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "A pendulum begins to swing with increasing energy.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A pendulum is released from an initial angle and begins to swing with conserved mechanical energy, gradually losing amplitude due to air resistance in a standard physics demonstration setup.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from a pendulum swinging with normal energy dissipation in a quiet laboratory, add a small battery pack mounted on the support beam, insulated copper wires connected to the pendulum bob, and an activated electromagnetic switch on the base—causing the pendulum to gain unnatural energy and swing with rapidly increasing amplitude."}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "A ball rolls uphill on its own, gaining energy as it moves.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A ball rolls downhill past a large oak tree and a mossy boulder, losing potential energy as it descends.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the ball rolling downhill past a large oak tree and a mossy boulder, the ball suddenly reverses direction and rolls uphill toward a weathered wooden signpost, gaining energy as it moves."}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "A tennis ball on the ground begins to move on its own, gaining kinetic energy in the horizontal direction.", "formal_reasonable_scene": "A tennis ball rests motionless on the ground of a tennis court, with a net visible in the background and a tennis racket lying idle on the surface nearby.", "editing_prompt": "Starting from the tennis ball stationary on the tennis court ground, flanked by a distant net and an unused racket, the ball abruptly accelerates horizontally across the surface without external influence, gaining kinetic energy while rolling unnaturally away from the racket."}
