Sunset Green Flash
",Physics,"Dispersion, Refraction","
At the very last moment of a tropical ocean sunset, the sun’s orange disk appear at the upper edge of the horizon.
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axOmIu71pTo,"
The green flash is a brief optical phenomenon at sunset caused by atmospheric dispersion and refraction of sunlight. As the sun sets, its light is bent through Earth’s atmosphere like a prism; shorter wavelengths (green/blue) are refracted slightly more and thus remain visible for an instant after the red light is obscured. Although blue light bends even more, it’s mostly scattered out, so the final burst of light appears green. This results in a split-second green glint just as the sun’s upper rim disappears.

Pilot’s Glory
",Physics,"Interference, Refraction","
Viewed from an airplane window, the plane’s own shadow on a cloud bank. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aq2bRQxSTc,"
A glory is a series of concentric, rainbow-colored rings that appear around the observer’s shadow (often from a plane or mountain) due to sunlight interacting with tiny cloud droplets. It arises from wave interference of light that is internally refracted and reflected within the mist droplets. The overlapping of internally refracted wavefronts produces constructive interference at certain angles, forming halo-like rings (reddish on the outer edge, bluish toward the center). This differs from a large rainbow in size and mechanism, creating a personal “mini-rainbow” around the shadow of the observer.

Diamond “Fire” Sparkle
",Physics,"Dispersion, Reflection, Refraction","
A faceted diamond ring is rotated under white light.",https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auvkUkgQ640,"A diamond’s famous sparkle comes from an interplay of reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light . Thanks to a very high refractive index, light entering the diamond is strongly refracted (bent) and then internally reflected multiple times by the cut facets. As those light rays finally exit, they are dispersed (split into spectral colors like a prism) – a property gemologists call fire . A well-cut diamond maximizes this effect, sending back concentrated flashes of colored light and white brilliance. In short, each facet acts like a tiny mirror and prism, creating the diamond’s multicolor scintillation.

Raw Egg Spinning,Physics,"Angular Momentum, Viscosity","A raw egg lies on a smooth flat table surface. A hand spins the egg rapidly, causing it to rotate at high speed. After the egg has been spinning for 2-3 seconds, a finger reaches in and briefly presses down on the top of the egg to stop its rotation completely. The finger is held there for about one second, then quickly lifted away.",https://youtu.be/_G5zNZf_6g4?si=uL2XBfTJ6lxuqkg1&t=121,"If you spin a raw egg, stop it briefly with your finger, and then release it, it will start spinning again.

Honey & Temperature,Physics,"Fluid Dynamics, Heat, Viscosity","Two identical spoons are held horizontally at the same height above a cold white plate.

Both spoons are tilted simultaneously to pour the honey onto the plate side by side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH2dpMO-frQ,"cold honey flows much slower, while warm honey flows more easily. This difference is because temperature affects molecular motion: cold honey has less molecular energy, causing the molecules to move closer together and resist flow more (higher viscosity), whereas heating honey increases molecular energy, allowing molecules to move further apart and flow more freely (lower viscosity).

Spinning Skater,Physics,"Angular Momentum, Diffusion",A figure skater spins rapidly in place on ice without translating across the surface.
