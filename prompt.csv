"Superheated liquid water that has been heated far above its boiling point is added to a glass pitcher. A metal fork is then carefully inserted into the hot water.","When the fork touches the superheated water, its rough surface and cooler temperature provide nucleation sites, triggering sudden and rapid boiling. Steam and bubbles form explosively throughout the liquid."
"A teardrop-shaped piece of tempered glass (Prince Rupert's Drop) is held at its bulbous head. Small pliers gently snip the thin tail end.","The entire drop explosively shatters into powder in a fraction of a second as the release of internal tension propagates through the glass at high speed."
"One wooden match is fixed upright on a flat surface so that it stands vertically. A second match is placed leaning diagonally against it, with their match heads touching at the top. The middle of the tilting match is then ignited.what would happen after few seconds?","The tilting match should start “levitating” after the match is lit. The tilted match appears to levitate because rising hot air from the burning matches produces an upward convection current that temporarily supports the lightweight, partially burned match after it detaches."
