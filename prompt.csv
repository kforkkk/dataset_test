A teardrop-shaped piece of tempered glass (Prince Rupert's Drop) is held at its bulbous head. Small pliers gently snip the thin tail end.,The entire drop explosively shatters into powder in a fraction of a second as the release of internal tension propagates through the glass at high speed.,94
"A straw wrapper paper tissue is crumpled into an accordion shape on a table. A drop of water is placed near one end of the crumpled paper, touching the paper.","The crumpled wrapper immediately begins expanding and crawling like a worm as water is absorbed through capillary action, causing the paper fibers to swell and straighten.",106
"An empty tea bag is unfolded into a cylinder, stood upright on a plate, and lit at the top edge with a match. The cylinder burns from top to bottom.","Just as the last bit finishes burning, the remaining ash lifts off and floats upward several feet because it becomes light enough for the hot air current to carry it as a glowing ember.",101
"A glass beaker (approximately 10 cm tall) is filled with a loosely coiled metal ball chain (the type with small spherical beads connected by short rods, commonly used for key chains or lamp pulls). The beaker is positioned at the very edge of a table so that its rim is flush with or slightly overhanging the table edge. The chain is coiled in the beaker with no particular order, forming a loose pile that fills most of the beaker's volume. A person grasps one free end of the chain that extends above the pile and drapes it over the rim of the beaker, letting about 10-15 cm hang down toward the floor. The person then releases this hanging end.","Once released, the hanging portion of chain accelerates downward under gravity, pulling more chain from the beaker. However, instead of simply sliding over the rim and falling straight down, the chain exhibits a dramatic and counterintuitive behavior: it rises up out of the beaker in an elegant upward arc or ""fountain"" that extends 10-20 cm above the rim before curving down toward the floor. The chain continuously flows up and out of the beaker in this graceful parabolic arc, resembling a fountain of metal beads suspended in mid-air. As the chain depletes from the beaker, the fountain remains stable and consistent until nearly all the chain has been pulled out.",103
A sealed plastic bottle is filled with water containing a floating eyedropper with an air bubble inside. A person squeezes the sides of the bottle.,"The eyedropper immediately sinks when the bottle is squeezed, then rises again when released, as increased pressure compresses the air bubble, reducing buoyancy.",98
"Three strips of different materials (paper towel, cotton cloth, and plastic film) are placed with their bottom edges touching colored water in a shallow dish, standing vertically.","The water climbs up the paper towel fastest, the cotton cloth slower, and barely rises on the plastic, demonstrating different capillary action based on material properties.",92
A dry spaghetti stick is held at both ends and slowly bent until it breaks.,"The spaghetti breaks into three or more pieces rather than two, because stress waves from the first fracture cause additional breaks before the fragments separate.",95
A small amount of lime juice is squeezed from a lime onto the surface of an inflated rubber balloon.,"The acid in the lime juice reacts with the rubber, breaking down its polymer structure. The weakened area loses elasticity, causing the balloon to pop where the juice touches it.",19
"Two beakers filled to the brim with deionized water are placed side by side, touching each other. High voltage electrodes are inserted into each beaker, and gradually the beakers are moved apart while voltage is applied.","A bridge of water forms and floats between the two beakers, defying gravity as electrostatic forces hold the water column together.",105
"One wooden match is fixed upright on a flat surface so that it stands vertically. A second match is placed leaning diagonally against it, with their match heads touching at the top. The middle of the tilting match is then ignited.","The tilting match should start “levitating” after the match is lit. The tilted match appears to levitate because rising hot air from the burning matches produces an upward convection current that temporarily supports the lightweight, partially burned match after it detaches.",17
"A small amount of water is added to an empty plastic bottle, which is sealed with a cap. A person squeezes and twists the bottom of the bottle several times to increase internal pressure, then the cap is suddenly released.","When the pressure is released, the air inside expands and cools rapidly, causing the water vapor to condense into tiny droplets that form a visible cloud.",15
"Five identical metal balls are suspended in a straight line by thin strings so that they hang just touching each other at rest. One ball on the end is pulled back and released, allowing it to swing and strike the others.","When the lifted ball strikes the row, the ball on the opposite end swings outward while the others remain nearly stationary, demonstrating conservation of momentum and energy.",16
"A metal slinky is held vertically by its top end, fully extended and hanging. The top end is suddenly released and the slinky is allowed to fall freely.","The bottom of the slinky remains stationary in mid-air for a moment while the top collapses downward, until the tension release information propagates down and the whole slinky falls together.",99
"A small, lightweight copper projectile is placed between two parallel copper rails, and a high current is momentarily discharged through the rails.","The massive current creates an enormous magnetic field that exerts a powerful Lorentz Force on the projectile, propelling it forward at high speed.",8
"A tall, narrow wine glass is mounted to a sturdy base. A speaker placed nearby emits a loud pure tone matching the glass's resonant frequency (pre-measured and set).","Within several seconds of loud sound exposure, the glass begins vibrating visibly and suddenly shatters as resonant amplification exceeds the material's strength.",96
"A strong neodymium magnet (approximately 2-3 cm in diameter) is mounted horizontally on a rigid stand at a height of about 15 cm above a table surface. A small, thin strip or piece of pure nickel metal (approximately 1 cm x 3 cm, and less than 3 mm thick) is suspended by a thin cotton thread or fishing line from a horizontal support rod. A lit candle is positioned on the table with its flame below the nickel piece.","Initially, the hanging nickel piece is strongly attracted by the magnetic field and pulls toward the magnet, hanging at an angle rather than straight down. The nickel remains suspended in this tilted position, held by magnetic attraction. As the candle flame heats the air below, the nickel piece warms. When the nickel reaches its Curie temperature, it suddenly loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic (only weakly magnetic). At this moment, the magnetic attraction abruptly disappears, and the nickel drops away from the magnet, swinging downward like a pendulum under gravity alone.",104
"A small amount of food coloring is mixed with oil in a cup, then poured slowly into a clear glass filled with water.","The oil remains floating on top of the water, while drops of food coloring fall through the oil layer and spread into the water, creating thin colorful strands.",18
"A flexible transparent tube carrying a steady stream of water is taped to the front of a speaker so that the open end extends outward, and water pours out of the tube. Camera view from 10 feet away, looking towards the speaker. The speaker begins to play a low-frequency sound while water continues to flow from the tube.","As the sound plays, pressure oscillations from the speaker cause the water stream to vibrate at the same frequency, forming visible spirals or standing-wave patterns that seem to move, freeze, or reverse depending on the playback frequency.",13
"A playing card is placed on top of a glass, and a coin is balanced on the card directly over the glass opening. The card is flicked horizontally away from the glass with a quick motion.","The coin drops straight down into the glass rather than following the card, demonstrating inertia as the coin tends to remain at rest while the card is removed quickly.",100

An empty aluminum soda can containing a small amount of boiling water is quickly inverted and plunged open-end-down into a bowl of ice water.,"The can instantly crumples and collapses with a loud bang as the steam inside rapidly condenses, creating a vacuum, and atmospheric pressure crushes the can.",97
A glass bottle is filled completely with water. The top of the bottle is struck straight down with a hammer.,"The sudden impact sends a pressure wave through the water. Because the liquid is nearly incompressible, the force transmits downward and reflects off the bottom, causing the base of the bottle to crack or shatter and water to pour out.",20
Two identical pendulums hang from the same horizontal string or rod. One pendulum is set swinging while the other hangs still.,"Within seconds, the moving pendulum begins to slow while the stationary one starts swinging, as energy transfers back and forth through the shared support via resonance.",102

A drop of water is carefully placed onto a metal pan heated to 250°C.,"The water drop forms a perfect sphere and glides across the surface without boiling, hovering on a cushion of its own vapor that insulates it from the hot metal.",91
"An apple has a long, thin wooden pole inserted through its center, with the apple sitting partway up the stick. It is held upright by a person. The person uses a hammer to deliver a few quick tap on the top end of the stick while the stick is kept straight.",The apple is expected to rise higher  on the stick with each hit of the hammer.,12
"A metal coin rests flat on a smooth tabletop. Using two fingers, the coin is turned onto its edge and is given a firm spin so that it rotates rapidly on its edge on the table.",The hand should spin the coin and the coin’s rotation should slowly start getting wider and wider due to gravity until it stops.,5
Two empty plastic bottles are attached to the ends of a horizontal wooden rod using string loops. The bottles are horizontal to the ground. The rod is balanced at its center on a pointed support so it can spin freely. A speaker is placed beneath each bottle and they produce tones at the bottles' resonant frequencies.,"When the speakers emit sound at the bottles’ resonant frequency, the air inside them vibrates strongly, creating pressure differences that cause the bottles to rotate around the central support.",9
A metal ring rests horizontally on top of an iron-core electromagnet coil. The coil is suddenly connected to a high-current DC power supply.,"The ring rapidly jumps several feet into the air as the suddenly changing magnetic field induces a current in the ring that creates an opposing magnetic field, causing strong repulsion.",93

"From a top-down view, a flat metal plate is attached horizontally to a vibration generator. A small amount of table salt is sprinkled evenly across the surface of the plate. The vibration frequency is gradually increased using a signal generator or connected smartphone.","As the frequency changes, the salt grains move and settle into distinct geometric patterns where the plate does not vibrate — the nodal lines of standing waves. Each frequency produces a unique pattern.",3
"A metal spinning top is placed at the center of a smooth tabletop. It is set in rapid rotation by hand using a twist of the fingers, with the tip in contact with the surface.",The top should start making larger and larger rotations due to the torque gravity.,4

A white styrofoam ball (approximately 5-8 cm in diameter) sits in a clear glass dish on a table.  A person holds a bottle of acetone and pours a steady stream directly onto the top of the styrofoam ball.,"When acetone is poured onto the styrofoam ball, the ball will rapidly shrink, collapse, and appear to vanish, leaving behind only a small amount of a gooey, viscous substance in the clear glass dish. As the polystyrene dissolves, the large amount of trapped air is released, often visibly as small bubbles or a fizzing effect.",90
Spin a raw egg and a cooked egg on a smooth surface; lightly stop each with a fingertip and then release.,"The raw egg starts spinning again due to the fluid interior continuing to move, while the cooked egg remains at rest.",159

Spin a turntable with two sliding masses near the rim and move the masses inward along radial tracks.,The rotation speeds up and the platform resists external twists because the moment of inertia decreases while angular momentum stays constant.,168
"Arrange two linear polarizers orthogonal to each other and shine a small laser spot through them, then insert a piece of transparent tape between the sheets.",The dark field brightens where the tape sits because the film rotates polarization and creates constructive transmission patterns.,156

"From a side view, two identical balls start at the same height. One is pushed horizontally off the edge of a table, while the other is released from rest at the same instant directly above the floor.","Both balls hit the ground at the same time because their vertical motions are identical. The ball that rolled off the table lands farther horizontally since it has a non-zero horizontal velocity, while the dropped ball lands directly below its release point.",147

One spoon contains honey that has been heated to approximately 40°C (warm but not hot), while the other spoon contains honey taken directly from the refrigerator at 4°C. Both spoons are tilted simultaneously to pour the honey onto the plate side by side.","cold honey flows much slower, while warm honey flows more easily.

"A sample of artificial metamaterial (a negative-refractive-index medium) is used, and a laser beam passes through the transparent slab of this metamaterial.","In the metamaterial slab the refractive index is engineered to be negative; incoming light is bent opposite the usual direction, and different wavelengths refract differently, producing a reversed-spectrum spread on the screen.",182
"In a dark room, a red laser beam is aimed through the side of a clear water bottle. A stream of water is poured from a hole on the opposite side such that the laser beam enters the water stream.","When the laser passes through the hole and into the flowing water, the beam bends and follows the curve of the stream instead of traveling straight — appearing as if the light is “flowing” with the water. This striking effect occurs due to total internal reflection, where the light continually reflects within the water–air boundary.",60

A small empty eyedropper floats in a sealed plastic bottle of water. A person squeezes the sides of the bottle. The person then lets go of the bottle.,"When the bottle is squeezed, the diver sinks smoothly to the bottom as the increased pressure compresses the air bubble inside it, raising its density. Once the pressure is released, the air bubble expands again, the diver’s density decreases, and it floats back to the top — demonstrating Pascal’s Principle and buoyancy control.",56

Use a lighter to ignite a small pile of a dry mixture of baking soda and sugar (in a 3:2 ratio) and observe the reaction.,"After ignition, the mixture begins to smolder and expand, producing a long, black, snake-like column that slowly grows outward from the pile. The structure is lightweight, porous, and carbon-rich.",221
"In slow motion, a shiny, cylindrical neodymium magnet is released to fall into a thick, vertically mounted polished copper pipe. Use a close-up shot against a dark background to highlight the motion.","The expected phenomenon is Eddy Current Braking (also known as Magnetic Damping or Lenz's Law). When a strong magnet moves relative to a non-ferromagnetic conductive material (like copper or aluminum), the moving magnetic field induces circulating electric currents (eddy currents) within the conductor. According to Lenz's Law, these induced currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the motion of the original magnet, resulting in a powerful and visibly smooth braking effect.",62
